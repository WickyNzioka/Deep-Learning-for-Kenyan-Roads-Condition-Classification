- **GitHub**: For repository hosting and collaboration.

### Business Problem

Manual road condition assessment methods, such as the Road Inventory and Condition Survey (RICS), are labor-intensive and prone to delays and inaccuracies. These challenges hinder effective maintenance planning and resource allocation, impacting road safety and transportation efficiency. Automating road condition assessment using computer vision can streamline the process, improve accuracy, and enable timely interventions. To illustrate the substantial scope of the survey, the team developed this [interactive dashboard](https://bit.ly/4a69As2) showcasing Kenya's extensive road network as managed by various Road Agencies i.e. KeNHA, KeRRA, KURA, and County Governments. 

### Objectives

- Develop an automated road condition classification system using computer vision and deep learning.
- Identify an optimal deep learning model architecture for accurately classifying road conditions
- Evaluate the impact of data augmentation on model performance and generalizability.
- Assess the effectiveness of transfer learning from pre-trained models in enhancing road condition classification.
- Analyze socio-economic impacts and policy implications of the automated system.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

Images of roads in varying conditions are scraped from various regions worldwide. The images are manually categorized into five categories: Good, Fair, Poor, Flooded, and Unpaved.


### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

A few roads from each of the categories are sampled to visually inspect the dataset's content. This step allows us to understand the visual representation of different road conditions and assess the diversity of the dataset.

  <div style="width: 20%; text-align: center;">
    <img src="Images/Fair.jpeg" alt="Fair Condition" style="width: 80%;">
    <p>Fair Condition</p>
  </div>
  <div style="width: 20%; text-align: center;">
    <img src="Images/Poor.jpeg" alt="Poor Condition" style="width: 80%;">
    <p>Poor Condition</p>
  </div>
  <div style="width: 20%; text-align: center;">
    <img src="Images/Flooded.jpeg" alt="Flooded Condition" style="width: 80%;">

  </div>
</div>




### Data Preprocessing

Steps include:
- Incompatible image extensions such as GIF are eliminated.
- The pixel values of images are adjusted to fall within the range of 0 to 1, aiding model convergence during training.
- Images are resized to a consistent size of 224x224 pixels to maintain uniformity across our dataset.
- Data augmentation techniques like rotations, flips, and shifts are applied to enlarge the training dataset and prevent overfitting.
